# Autoware Trajectory Processor

## Autoware Trajectory Optimizer

The `autoware_trajectory_optimizer` package generates smooth and feasible trajectories for autonomous vehicles using a plugin-based optimization pipeline. It takes candidate trajectories as input and applies a sequence of optimization plugins to produce smooth, drivable trajectories with proper velocity and acceleration profiles.

### Features

- **Plugin-based architecture** - Modular optimization pipeline where each step is a separate plugin
- **Multiple smoothing methods**:
  - Elastic Band (EB) smoother for path optimization
  - Akima spline interpolation for smooth path interpolation
  - QP-based smoother with quadratic programming for path smoothing with jerk constraints
- **Velocity optimization** - Jerk-filtered velocity smoothing from `autoware_velocity_smoother`
- **Temporal MPT optimization** - acados MPC (8 s / 0.1 s horizon) on a kinematic bicycle with x, y, yaw, and speed states
- **Trajectory validation** - Removes invalid points and fixes trajectory orientation
- **Backward trajectory extension** - Extends trajectory using past ego states
- **Dynamic parameter reconfiguration** - Runtime parameter updates supported

## Architecture

The package uses a pluginlib-based architecture where optimization plugins are dynamically loaded at startup. Each plugin inherits from `TrajectoryOptimizerPluginBase` and is loaded via the ROS 2 pluginlib system.

### Plugin Loading and Execution

Plugins are loaded based on the `plugin_names` parameter, which defines both which plugins to load and their execution order:

```yaml
plugin_names:
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryPointFixer"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryQPSmoother"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryEBSmootherOptimizer"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectorySplineSmoother"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryVelocityOptimizer"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryExtender"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryPointFixer"
```

### Available Plugins

1. **TrajectoryPointFixer** - Removes invalid/repeated points and fixes trajectory direction
2. **TrajectoryQPSmoother** - QP-based path smoothing with jerk constraints
3. **TrajectoryEBSmootherOptimizer** - Elastic Band path smoothing
4. **TrajectorySplineSmoother** - Akima spline interpolation
5. **TrajectoryMPTOptimizer** - Model predictive trajectory optimization with adaptive corridor bounds. Uses bicycle kinematics model for trajectory refinement. Disabled by default (experimental). See [docs/mpt_optimizer.md](docs/mpt_optimizer.md) for details.
6. **TrajectoryTemporalMPTOptimizer** - Temporal acados MPC path tracking on a time-ordered reference (8.0 s horizon, 0.1 s discretization). Must be listed in `plugin_names` and enabled via `use_temporal_mpt_optimizer`. See [docs/temporal_mpt_optimizer.md](docs/temporal_mpt_optimizer.md) for details.
7. **TrajectoryVelocityOptimizer** - Velocity profile optimization with lateral acceleration limits
8. **TrajectoryExtender** - Extends trajectory backward using past ego states
9. **TrajectoryKinematicFeasibilityEnforcer** - Enforces Ackermann steering and yaw rate constraints

Each plugin can be enabled/disabled at runtime via activation flags (e.g., `use_qp_smoother`) and manages its own configuration independently.

### ⚠️ Important: Plugin Ordering Constraints

**The order of plugin execution is critical and must be carefully maintained:**

- **QP Smoother must run before EB/Akima smoothers**: The QP solver relies on constant time intervals (Δt) between trajectory points (default: 0.1s). Both Elastic Band and Akima spline smoothers resample trajectories without preserving the time domain structure, which breaks the QP solver's assumptions. Therefore, when using multiple smoothers together, the QP smoother must execute first.

- **Trajectory Extender positioning**: The trajectory extender has known discontinuity issues when placed early in the pipeline. It negatively affects the QP solver results and introduces artifacts. For this reason, it has been moved to near the end of the pipeline and is **disabled by default** (`use_trajectory_extender: false`). Fixing the extender's discontinuity issues is future work.

- **Temporal MPT vs spatial MPT**: `TrajectoryTemporalMPTOptimizer` is independent of `TrajectoryMPTOptimizer` (different solver, no corridor bounds). It can replace the entire post-`TrajectoryPointFixer` plugin chain (kinematic enforcer, QP/EB/spline smoothers, velocity optimizer, spatial MPT) with a single MPC step; see [docs/temporal_mpt_optimizer.md](docs/temporal_mpt_optimizer.md). It overwrites at most the first 81 points (8.0 s at 0.1 s spacing).

### Design Specification

For a detailed description of the optimizer's core assumptions, the constant-dt contract,
how velocity and acceleration are derived from positions, plugin pipeline specification, and
known limitations, see [docs/trajectory_optimizer_specification.md](docs/trajectory_optimizer_specification.md).

### QP Smoother

The QP smoother uses quadratic programming (OSQP solver) to optimize trajectory paths with advanced features:

- **Objective**: Minimizes path curvature while maintaining fidelity to the original trajectory
- **Decision variables**: Path positions (x, y) for each trajectory point
- **Constraints**: Fixed initial position (optionally fixed last position)
- **Velocity-based fidelity**: Automatically reduces fidelity weight at low speeds for aggressive smoothing of noise
- **Post-processing**: Recalculates velocities, accelerations, and orientations from smoothed positions

**For detailed documentation**, see [docs/qp_smoother.md](docs/qp_smoother.md) which covers:

- Mathematical formulation
- Velocity-based fidelity weighting (sigmoid function)
- Parameter tuning guidelines
- Usage examples
- Performance characteristics

### Parameters

{{ json_to_markdown("planning/autoware_trajectory_processor/schema/trajectory_optimizer.schema.json") }}

Parameters can be set via YAML configuration files in the `config/` directory.

#### Parameter Types

1. **Plugin Loading** (`plugin_names`) - Array of plugin class names determining load order and execution sequence
2. **Activation Flags** - Boolean flags for runtime enable/disable (e.g., `use_qp_smoother`, `use_temporal_mpt_optimizer`)
3. **Plugin-Specific Parameters** - Namespaced parameters for each plugin (e.g., `trajectory_qp_smoother.weight_smoothness`)

#### Configuring Plugin Order

To change plugin execution order, modify the `plugin_names` array in `config/trajectory_optimizer.param.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example: Run spline smoother before velocity optimizer
plugin_names:
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryPointFixer"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectorySplineSmoother"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryVelocityOptimizer"
  - "autoware::trajectory_optimizer::plugin::TrajectoryPointFixer"
```

##### CRITICAL: QP Smoother Ordering Constraint

The `TrajectoryQPSmoother` plugin **MUST run before** any plugins that resample or modify trajectory structure:

- `TrajectorySplineSmoother` (Akima spline - resamples trajectory)
- `TrajectoryEBSmootherOptimizer` (Elastic Band - resamples trajectory)
- `TrajectoryVelocityOptimizer` (velocity smoothing with resampling)
- `TrajectoryExtender` (adds/modifies points at trajectory start)

The QP solver requires constant time intervals (Δt = 0.1s) between points. These plugins modify the time domain structure or add points, breaking the QP solver assumptions. If you need QP smoothing, it must appear first in the pipeline after `TrajectoryPointFixer`.

Note: Plugin order changes require node restart. Runtime enable/disable is controlled by activation flags.

## Autoware Trajectory Modifier

The `autoware_trajectory_modifier` package provides a plugin-based architecture for post-processing trajectory points to improve trajectory quality and ensure vehicle safety. It takes candidate trajectories and applies various modification algorithms to enhance their feasibility and safety characteristics.

### Features

- Plugin-based architecture for extensible trajectory modifications
- Stop point fixing to prevent trajectory issues near stationary conditions
- Obstacle detection and stopping to prevent collision
- Configurable parameters to adjust modification behavior

### Architecture

The trajectory modifier uses a plugin-based system where different modification algorithms can be implemented as plugins. Each plugin inherits from the `TrajectoryModifierPluginBase` class and implements the required interface.

#### Plugin Interface

All modifier plugins must inherit from `TrajectoryModifierPluginBase` and implement:

- `modify_trajectory()` - Main method to modify trajectory points
- `on_initialize()` - Initialize plugin members and parameters
- `update_params()` - Handle parameter updates
- `is_trajectory_modification_required()` - Determine if modification is needed

#### Current Plugins

##### Stop Point Fixer

The Stop Point Fixer plugin addresses trajectory issues when the ego vehicle is stationary or moving at very low speeds. It prevents problematic trajectory points that could cause planning issues by replacing the trajectory with a single stop point when either of two independently configurable conditions is met:

- **Close stop**: the trajectory's last point (stop point) is within a minimum distance threshold from ego
- **Long stop**: the trajectory commands ego to remain stopped for longer than a minimum duration threshold

Both conditions are individually enabled or disabled via parameters, allowing fine-grained control over when the override is applied.

##### Obstacle Stop

The Obstacle Stop plugin serves as a deterministic safety shield operating independently of the generative model to:

- **Enforce Longitudinal Safety**: Monitors the gap to dynamic and static obstacles to ensure a safe distance is maintained under all kinematic conditions.
- **Ensure Definitive Stopping For Obstacles**: Guarantees zero-velocity set-points for stationary objects (e.g., traffic lights, stopped vehicles) to prevent "creeping" or oscillating behavior near obstacles.

##### Velocity Modifier

The Velocity Modifier plugins is responsible for ensuring the velocity profile is smooth and feasible, and adjusts the velocity profile if an anomaly is detected while respecting deceleration and jerk constraints.

The last-resort (non-object) obstacle input is the sensing obstacle grid (`grid_map_msgs/msg/GridMap` on `~/input/obstacle_grid`, `base_link` frame, layers `point_count` / `min_height` / `low_max_height`), replacing the former raw obstacle pointcloud. Each frame the plugin gates cells (`point_count >= min_point_count_cell`, `low_max_height >= clustering.min_height`, and `min_height <=` ego height `+ height_buffer`), keeps 8-connected components whose summed `point_count` reaches `clustering.min_size`, and feeds the surviving cell centers (transformed `base_link -> map` via the ego pose) to the point tracker. Notes:

- Because centers rather than cell corners are emitted, corridor membership at the trajectory-polygon edge carries a bounded error of at most half a cell diagonal (~0.14 m at the 0.2 m production resolution). This is accepted for this default-off (`enable_stop_for_pointcloud: false`) consumer.
- `clustering.min_size` sums raw pre-voxel returns (the grid is not voxel-downsampled), so a threshold tuned for the old post-voxel Euclidean-cluster size may need to be raised.
- The height floor is now applied **per cell** (`low_max_height >= clustering.min_height`) instead of the legacy **per-cluster** test (which kept an entire Euclidean cluster once any single point in it reached the height floor). This is more conservative for overhead structures (a gantry sharing a cell with ground residue no longer qualifies the cell), but it is not strictly more conservative in every case: a low, spread obstacle whose only above-floor cell carries fewer than `clustering.min_size` returns can be missed, whereas the legacy per-cluster test would have kept the whole cluster (low cells included) and stopped. The default-off (`enable_stop_for_pointcloud: false`) gating keeps the real-world exposure low, and `clustering.min_height` / `min_size` should be tuned together for the deployed sensor.
- A stale grid (older than `obstacle_grid_timeout_sec`), a non-`base_link` frame, or a grid missing a required layer is treated as unavailable (throttled error, no new stop from this branch) and never as "clear"; the point tracker is left untouched, so a stale frame inserts no new stop and does not age the tracker (if `enable_stop_for_pointcloud` is enabled, a grid outage suppresses the pointcloud stop for the duration of the outage rather than holding the previous one).
