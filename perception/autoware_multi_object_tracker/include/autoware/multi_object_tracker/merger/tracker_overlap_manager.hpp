/// - The merge outcome is a pure function of the tracker states: pair direction comes from a
///   lexicographic dominance comparison ending in the tracker UUID, so results do not depend on
///   tracker_list order.
/// - The winner of a merge must be confident and carry a parametric shape (bounding box or
///   cylinder); polygon-only trackers may only be absorbed — two polygon-only trackers never
///   merge. A winner the publish gate would drop never absorbs a tracker the gate keeps.
/// - Applied merges form a star forest per cycle (no tracker both absorbs and is absorbed);
///   longer chains converge over subsequent cycles with direct geometry checks.
